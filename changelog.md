### Version 0.4.2
FIXES:
- Fixed an issue where not having Dice So Nice installed would break everything.

### Version 0.4.1
CHANGES:
- Shifted the module to make use of Foundry's built-in blind rolls
- Removed the custom roll hidden message setting since it's no longer required
- Added partial support for Dice So Nice (works with vanilla dnd5e, but not with MESS or Better Rolls 5e)
FIXES:
- Rolls are now hidden correctly regardless of what translations users are using
BROKEN:
- A bug in MESS preventing blind rolls from displaying correctly means that you will encounter problems using this module with MESS's alternative rolls enabled. Once that's fixed, everything should work great.
