# Crash's Hide Skill Rolls
This is a module for dnd5e that allows the DM to always hide the results of specified skills from players. This is handy in case you don't want the results of an Insight or Perception check to tip your players off. Supports vanilla dnd5e (with or without DSN) and Better Rolls (without DSN).

# Compatibility / Known Issues
## Works With
- Vanilla dnd5e
- Better Rolls 5e

## Does Not Work With
- MESS. Moerill has stated he's going to be removing the roll functionality and possibly deprecating MESS in the near future. I'll look into supporting whatever the replacement for MESS alt rolls is, if and when it becomes a thing.

## Partial Support
- Dice So Nice works with vanilla dnd5e, but does NOT work in conjunction with Better Rolls. Hopefully that'll be changing down the line as Red Reign continues to make improvements to BR!
