# Crash's Hide Skill Rolls
This module allows the DM to always hide the results of specified skills from players. This is handy in case you don't want the results of an Insight or Perception check to tip your players off.

# Compatibility / Known Issues
## Works With
- Better Rolls 5e
- MESS

## Does Not Work With
- Dice So Nice (the dice will still be shown, but the results will be hidden)

## Translation Troubles
- Players using modules to translate the dnd5e system will be able to see the results of rolls made by other players not using the same translations. If one player is using Spanish and everyone else is using German, the German players will see the Spanish rolls, and the Spanish player will see the German rolls. If everyone is using the same language, rolls will be hidden appropriately.
