# Crash's 5e Blind Roll Skills
This module allows the DM to always hide the results of specified skills from players. This is handy in case you don't want the results of an Insight or Perception check to tip your players off.

I made this for use in a home game, and at this time I have no plans to distribute it widely. You're welcome to fork and modify or even publish it if you need functionality that this does not provide.

Contact me on Discord (CRASH1115#2944). I make no promises to provide support for this module, since I only use it for my home games.
